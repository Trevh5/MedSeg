First, install anaconda
	https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/

After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt window and type the following commands and wait for installation to complete:

	conda create --name localkeras_win python=3.6

	activate localkeras_win

	conda install -c conda-forge nibabel nilearn pytables 

	conda install theano keras numpy scipy tensorflow-gpu


Now, you need to modify the keras.json file to force keras to use tensorflow as a ML backend

Open
%USERPROFILE%/.keras/keras.json
and change "theano" to "tensorflow"


Download and unzip MedSeg.
	https://github.com/Trevh5/MedSeg3D

Navigate to and open ct_ventricles_predict.py in the "MedSeg" folder
	Change the following lines to be specific to your computer:
		model_dir="C:\\Users\\Trevor\\Desktop\\My Python Code\\MedSeg3D\\models\\"  # This is the folder that has the ML models
		test_dir="C:\\Users\\Trevor\\Desktop\\ventricle_segmentations\\0000312-063\\" 
			Note: If you are going to use ct_ventricles_predict.py to do the segmentation, you will have to rename your scan to be CT.nii.gz
				The folder structure should be:
					Primary folder (this is the directory that should be indicated by model_dir)
						Patient folder
							CT.nii.gz

				If it is too annoying to make this folder structure each time you want to segment an image, you can always rewrite the code to work the way you want. I wrote the code originally to work with the file structure for our dataset.

Now you should be able to run python ct_ventricles_predict.py!!
Feel free to play around with the code to make it work better with your system.

NOTE: Make sure your cuda drivers are up to date!!
